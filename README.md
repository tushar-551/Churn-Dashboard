# PwC Virtual Internship - Churm Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn and retention for a telecommunications company. The objective is to provide actionable insights to the retention manager by creating a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer churn.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized for this analysis contains detailed information about customers, including their demographic profiles, account details, and subscribed services. The dataset was provide by [Forge] (https://github.com/tushar11720/Churn-Dashboard/blob/main/02%20Churn-Dataset.xlsx) as part of their virtual internship program.

## Tools and Technologies
- Power BI Desktop: Employed for data modeling, transformation, and visualization.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized for creating calculated measures and custom columns.
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Operations: Performed to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis.

## Key Findings and Insights
- The overall churn rate stands at 26.54%, indicating a significant portion of customers discontinuing their services.
- Customers with fiber optic internet service exhibit the highest churn rate at 41.89%.
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate at 42.71% compared to longer-term contracts.
